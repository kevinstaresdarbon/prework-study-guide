# prework-study-guide

## A simple website to document learning from the prework-study

This website was a required part of my bootcamp in Front-End Web Development with edX.
I built this project to refresh some knowledge around HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and GitHub with guidance and tutorials from the prework-study-guide course.
It provides a place for me to collect and review my learning as I progress through the course and display it on a simple webpage.
It has also provided some interesting practice into using git, github and the git workflow.
It has refreshed my knowledge on CSS, HTML and JavaScript but most importantly it has given me valuable experience in the git workflow.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

None required, wysiwyg

## Usage

This simple page provides very little functionality through the web-browser, it is mainly static html and css.  To add learning notes to the various sections you will need to edit the index.html directly.

Beyond this, you can open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser which will display some cute messages on the topics covered and a random selection of which topic to dive into today.

## Credits

This page was coded with guidance from the prework-study-guide to edX's bootcamp in Front-End Web Development which is provided to those enrolled on this course.
