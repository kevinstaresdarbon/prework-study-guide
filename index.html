        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li> The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li> There are still some semantic tags that appear within the body like "section"</li>
          <li> HTML uses opening and closing tags for elements. closing tags use the same name as the opening tag but prefixed with /</li>
          <li> In HTML you should use the h1 to h6 tags in numerical order within each section to create a natural look and flow and the h1 tag should only be used once on a page for its main header</li>
          <li> Elements can contain additional information stored in the value of its attributes</li>
          <li> The class attribute is often used to help target the element with some CSS styling</li>
          <li> The id attribute is typically used to help target the element with Javascript</li>
          <li> The ul (unordered list) element or ol (ordered list) contains a group of li (list item) elements to arrange them in an automatically bullet pointed list on screen</li>
          <li> the html element is the root element and can contain a lang attribute of two letter codes that tells the browser the desired language to use; en stands for english</li>
          <li> The head tag is used to declare metadata and import libraries and styles from external sources</li>
          <li> The script tag is generally used to import and run some javascript</li>
          <li> the p tag defines a body of text to be formatted as a single paragraph</li>
          <li> br can be used as a self closing tag to enter a seperating line between elements </li>
          <li> Many tags can "self-close", which is to say you can close it with a / just before the end of the element tag instead of using a seperate closing tag.</li>
          <li> The title tag that is used in the head section does visibly affect our tab by changing the text within the title of the open tab</li>
          <li> The body tag is where we write almost all of the visible markup for the page</li>
          <li> div and span tags help us to control and divide the screen into different functional areas that can be targetted by Javascript and CSS</li>
          <li> The img tag is used to bring images into our webpage from a particular src (source)</li>
          <li> The a element defines an anchor, generally used to create a hyperlink to another page on the internet, possibly outside of our current site by including the url in the href attribute</li>
          <li> header, main and footer are tags used to seperate our elements into specified zones.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>  CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. </li>
          <li>  Styles are applied to the web elements by using a selector and a declaration block that is simply a list of declarations linking CSS Properties to their corresponding values</li>
          <li>  Styles can be declared in 3 main ways: <ol class="internal">  <li> inline style which is declared using the style attribute within an element opening tag that affects the particual element</li>  
                                                                              <li> internal style sheet which is declared using the style tag in the header and defining all the rules for elements within the particular page</li>
                                                                              <li> external style sheet which is declared in its own file, typically using the .css extension, and is imported into the html document using the link tag with a rel attribute set to stylesheet and a href attribute pointing to the .css file location</li>
                                                        </ol> </li>
          <li>  The selector can take various formats.  you can plainly state an HTML element such as h2 to target all h2 elements. </li>
          <li>  The selector, if it begins with a . targets a class defined in the class attributes on various elements.  i.e.  the selector .example would target all elements with the class attribute set to example  </li>
          <li>  Using classes well will create a thematic styling across many elements and reduce lines of code </li>
          <li>  If various styles are uniform across many selectors you can use commas to specify many selectors for one declaration block</li>
          <li>  DRY code is an acronym for "Don't Repeat Yourself" code which seeks to reduce complexity and size of the codebase</li>
          <li>  The margin property controls the amount of space around an element outside of its border </li>
          <li>  The padding property controls the amount of space within the border area of an element </li>
          <li>  The border property controls the look and feel of the space between the margin and the padding </li>
          <li>  The content of an element appears inside of the padding</li>
          <img class="cardImage" src="./assets/310-box-model.png" alt="image depicting the zones of the box model." />
          <li>  The * selector is a special wildcard element that applies its styles to every element within scope </li>
          <li>  CSS3 has a rather large amount of properties and associated acceptable values.  Here's a link to a CSS3 complete cheat sheet that contains a good deal of css3 properties and values for future reference ----~> <a href="https://websitesetup.org/css3-cheat-sheet/">CSS CHEAT SHEET</a> </li>

        <h2>GIT</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> GIT is a version control tool that is used widely by development teams</li>
          <li> GIT and  GITHUB makes it a lot easier for developers to work individually and as a collaborative effort upon a code base</li>
          <li> A reference of git commands can be found here for ease of reference here ---~> <a href="https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf">GIT CHEAT SHEET</a></li>
          <li> The git workflow of branching, editing, pulling and merging is essential knowledge for any software developer </li>
          <li> The main branch usually contains the code for the live site that is being developed or maintained</li>
          <li> Its important to branch before making any changes to the code base so that your edited code does not immediately effect or derail the main branch by adding errors or unoptimised features</li>
          <li> Its a typical convention to name your branch depending on what specifically you're trying to do for the ease of reference of other developers on your team. Usually something like "feature/updated hyperlinks"</li>
          <li> Try to isolate each branch to only editing a specific feature or resolve a particular issue to help avoid merge conflicts and to make it easier to merge your code or do less work to revert ineffective changes</li>
          <li> Pull requests are an important part of the workflow as they allow your code to be reviewed and discussed before the changes are merged into another branch.  This helps to ensure quality of code, functionality and reduces the likelyhood of breaking a branch or a build</li>
          <li> "Git ignore" is an extremely important command when working with npm toolchains as it stops you from committing unecessary code and helps protect your credential files </li>
          <li> Staging is an important concept to grasp.  Once branched you can edit the files on your branch at will but nothing will change with a "git push" or "git commit" if you have not staged the files to change with "git add" first</li>
          <li> GITHUB is an incredibly useful website that hosts developers repositiories and comes with in-built tools like "Issues", "wiki" and "project" to help document, plan and delegate work that is done on the code base</li>
          <li> GITHUB also allows for the storage and use of ssh keys to protect and validate your work for authenticating and signing your materials / commits</li>
